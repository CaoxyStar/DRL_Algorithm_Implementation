# DRL_Algorithm_Implementation
This is a repository about the implementation of many deep reinforcement learning algorithms.

- Policy gradient ( On-Policy, Monte Carlo, Continuous Action Space )
- Actor-Critic ( Off-Policy, Temporal Difference, Continuous Action Space )
- Deep Q-Learning ( Off-Policy, Temporal Difference, Discrete Action Space )
- Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient ( Off-Policy, Temporal Difference, Continuous Action Space )
- Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient ( Off-Policy, Temporal Difference, Continuous Action Space )
- Proximal Policy Optimization
