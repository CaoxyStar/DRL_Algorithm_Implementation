# DRL_Algorithm_Implementation
This is a repository about the implementation of many deep reinforcement learning algorithms.

- Policy gradient ( A off-policy version using Monte Carlo )
- Actor-Critic ( A off-policy version using temporal difference )
- Deep Q-Learning ( A basic version with hard update )
- Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient ( A bacis version with soft update )
- Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient ( The improved version based on DDPG )
- Proximal Policy Optimization
